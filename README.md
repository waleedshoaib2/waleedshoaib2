# 💫 About Me:
💼 I’m currently working on:<br>Developing and maintaining the social media platform "Rabbito" at Objex, using microservices architecture on Google Cloud Platform to ensure scalability and reliability. I’m focusing on optimizing GraphQL APIs, integrating multiple third-party APIs (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube), and building real-time data pipelines with Google Pub/Sub.<br><br>🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on:<br>Open-source AI/ML projects, modern frontend libraries like React components, and cloud-native applications. I am particularly interested in decentralized social networking projects using protocols like ActivityPub, real-time data processing applications, and tools that help optimize API performance and scalability.<br><br>🤲 I’m looking for help with:<br>Advanced Node.js scalability strategies, optimizing GraphQL API performance, and implementing efficient Firestore indexing for complex queries. I would also appreciate insights on best practices for serverless architecture, cost optimization on GCP, and effective load balancing techniques.<br><br>🌱 I’m currently learning:<br>Relational calculus for deepening my understanding of database theory, advanced Firestore indexing techniques to reduce read and write costs, and prompt engineering to enhance conversational AI systems. Additionally, I’m exploring cloud infrastructure optimization on GCP and modern JavaScript/TypeScript patterns.<br><br>💬 Ask me about:<br>React, Next.js, backend optimization, and integrating APIs like Facebook Graph, YouTube, and LinkedIn. I can also share insights on building scalable microservices on GCP and using GraphQL to optimize data handling.<br><br>⚡ Fun fact:<br>I think I am funny, I’m an avid fan of both cricket and football, and I love playing chess. I also enjoy reading books, particularly those by Haruki Murakami.
