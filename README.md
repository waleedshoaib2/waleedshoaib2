From the moment I first watched Elliot Alderson in "Mr. Robot," I was captivated by the power and potential of coding. Elliot’s journey into the depths of technology sparked a passion in me that has only grown stronger with time.

Interestingly, my path to software development wasn’t straightforward. I initially pursued a pre-med track, driven by a desire to help people and make a difference. However, as time passed and I became more self-aware, I realized that my true passion lay elsewhere. The logic, creativity, and endless possibilities of coding drew me in, and I decided to make the leap into software development.

Now, with three years of hands-on experience, I specialize in building robust, scalable applications. Throughout my career, I’ve had the opportunity to work on diverse projects that have honed my skills in various programming languages and frameworks. My core expertise lies in:

-Front-End Development: Crafting intuitive, user-friendly interfaces with React.js and Next.js.

-Back-End Development: Building reliable, high-performance APIs and services using Node.js.

-Full-Stack Development: Bridging the gap between front-end and back-end, ensuring seamless integration and functionality.

What sets me apart is my relentless curiosity and problem-solving mindset. I thrive on tackling challenging problems, whether it's optimizing a complex algorithm or designing a seamless user experience. My work is driven by a desire to create meaningful, impactful software that not only meets user needs but also pushes the boundaries of what’s possible.

As I continue to grow in my career, I am excited about the endless possibilities that lie ahead. Whether it's contributing to open-source projects, exploring new technologies, or driving innovation within a forward-thinking team, I am committed to making a positive impact in the tech world.

Let’s connect and explore how we can build the future together.
